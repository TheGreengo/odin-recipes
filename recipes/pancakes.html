        <p>Here's a great buttermilk pancakes recipe:</p>
        <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine dry ingredients in a mixing bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add in the buttermilk, eggs, and butter 
                and gently mix until combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add milk in, a bit at a time until the 
                mixture achieves the consistency of 
                pancake batter
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook them tasty flapjacks on a buttered 
                griddle and serve with maple syrup. Some
                 will say to use other toppings, they are 
                 wrong. Don't associate with those people. 
                 They can only bring you down.
